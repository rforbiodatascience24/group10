Now It is time for the bestest part of the whole script

```{r}
GroupMembers <- c("Amalie","Johanna","Sofie","Marie","Malou")

Student_ids <- c("s204643","s203566","s203566","s203515","s204657","s194678")
```

## Johanna

## Sofie

## Malou

Now we will add some changes to the document, so that we can update and see all other peoples changes. Here is a simple one:

```{r}
x <- 2+2
