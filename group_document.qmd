# Lab 7 - Group 10

## Marie

We want to define x and y as two vectors for later use

```{r}

#defining x
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,3)
x
#defining y
y <- c(9,7,6,5,4,3)
y
```

### New feature

No we try to multiply the vectors to get vector c:

```{r}
# Combining the vectors x and y
c <- x + y
c
```

## Johanna

## Sofie

## Malou

Now we will add some changes to the document, so that we can update and see all other peoples changes. Here is a simple one:

```{r}
x <- 2+2
x
```
